Project time tracker! Les will now track how much time you spend on a project. To check out how much time you've spent, simple click "Project Time" in the tray.

Added the ability to disable the Ctrl + W command.

Added the ability to disable the Ctrl + W command.
Made the piano roll macro error much more friendly looking (with added instructions!).
The show automation lanes shortcut now also works even if you're using Live in different languages.

--1.3--

LES is now open source; and all the source code has been documented using comments.
https://github.com/inversil/LESwin
https://github.com/inversil/LESosx

WINDOWS:

Fixed middle click to pan on logitech office mice, including all mice in the MX master series.
the search query is now always properly cleared, even when loading large vsts; without using the overly complicated bookmark feature.
the "strict time" setting is now stored across sessions
LES now warns you when users when it is executed from within the temp folder
piano roll detection should now misdetect slightly less

Added Buplicate!
	- Use Ctrl + B to duplicate something 7 times! Press Ctrl + B again on the same element duplicate again 8 times!
	- Quickly duplicate an initial single clip in blocks of Eight
	- It's more useful than you'd think

it's time for VST specific shortcuts!

Xfer Serum:
	- use the 1,2,3 and 4 key to switch tabs between osc, fx, matrix and global respectively.

Fabfilter Pro Q 3 (vst2, or vst3 without custom resizing):
	- For some reason Ableton Live doesn't properly communicate undo's to pro Q. This macro fixes undo and redo actions inside the plugin by remapping the undo and redo shortcuts to click the buttons at the top.
	- Since I'm not a magician, the undos and redos will behave jank as usual when the plugin window is unfocussed.

Kick 2:
	- The same thing as pro-q, except for Kick 2

Sylenth1:
	- use the 1 and 2 keys to switch between A and B tabs. (Although it's a toggle so you can also just hit 1 constantly)

Massive:
	- Use keys 1 through 5 to mute and unmute oscillators 1 through 5 (this includes PM/RM and noise)

Phase Plant (BETA):
- These shortcuts are disabled and will not work unless a cheat is entered. 
There is a problem with them that I cannot figure out how to fix, but I left them in in case someone wants to play around with them.
- If you want to access the Phaseplant shortcuts, enable debug mode in the settings. Then, spam press hit both shift keys at once while in ableton live to open the cheat menu.
Enter "kilohearts" to enable the shortcuts.

	Use Alt + A to add an analog oscillator
	Use Alt + N to add a noise oscillator
	Use Alt + S to add a sample oscillator
	Use Alt + W to add a wavetable oscillator
	Use Alt + D to add a distortion oscillator
	Use Alt + F to add a filter oscillator
	Use Alt + O to add an output.
	
	Use Alt + L to add an LFO

VST specific shortcuts can be toggled on and off in the settings.
Ctrl + F1 or the PAUSE key can be used to toggle LES functionality on and off with ease.
	- you can toggle LES off if a VST shortcut is conflicting with something else you want to do

Added more safety checks to shortcuts so you can't trigger them out of context as much.
**Added an option to increase scrolling speed, scroll around faster by changing the value in settings.ini**
Removed "superspeedmode" from the settings. LES has been stable enough for a while to the point that it's no longer nescesary to have a toggle for this.
Removed the safe automation open shortcut. Changes to the 10.1 context menus cause it to malfunction too often.
Changed a japanese word in the black midi easter egg joke so it means "death" rather than telling the users to "die"


++MACOS++

Fixed unintentional behavior where single character menu items would be cleared
Added more safety checks to shortcuts so you can't trigger them out of context as much.
