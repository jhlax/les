$Page Wow! You found me!

This project was made in such a way that it could be compiled into the Autohotkey script without taking up too much space, as a large project would be very difficult to hide.
We managed to fit this entire song inside a 2mb exe file! 
For consistency we also decided to include it in the MacOS version.
So without further ado, here's a wacky song we made in a few hours, just for your enjoyment :)

- Inverted Silence & Aevi
