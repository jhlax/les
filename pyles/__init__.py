pyles -- Python implementation of LES
=====================================

:author: John Harrington
:version: 0.0.1-alpha

this is our root module. it will have the most important classes and functions
immediately available upon import; more specialized functionality is contained
in submodules.

    this is in no way stable; don't use for non-development use. its going
    to change. a lot.
